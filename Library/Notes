Add flight:

User: 
Origin Id
Destination id
Airplane type

need entity/domain/pojo objects to hold user objects
getter and setters to retrieve data - no business logic

DAO - design pattern where you isolate the code of talking to the databases
only to a particular package
# of DAO's = # of tables

check/insert originId and desId into airport table
insert into route (orid, desid) values ('ABC', 'DEF'); - Exception
insert into airplane table


DB Transaction - same connection object
